		<h1>All About Me</h1>
		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

		<p>
			My name is Alicia Wilson, I’m in 10th grade. I love tech and learning new things.<br> 
			I have an older sister in university, who is 19 and her name is Tia. I have two cats<br>
			(Carly and Tinsel) and one dog (Bear). I would say I'm a pretty <em>shy</em> person<br>
			and quiet person, but with my friends I have a super loud personality. If I were to<br>
			describe myself with three words I'd say I'm welcoming, kind, and creative.

		<h2>Life Goals</h2>
		<p>
			My goals in my school life are to succeed in my classes as well as I can,<br>
			because I like to believe that if I'm trying my hardest, that's the best thing<br>
			I can do for myself! My goals for my future are just to make sure I find what<br>
			I want to do because I am a <strong>very</strong> indecisive person. Making sure<br>
			I live to my <strong>fullest</strong> potential by living a calm paced, but super fun life is what<br>
			I strive for.

		<h2>How I would survie a zombie apocalypse</h2>
		<p>
			My first step to becoming the best zombie fighter would be to collect my equipment.<br>
			My choice of weapon would be the <em>most compact and strong portable pressure washer</em>,<br>
			my reasoning is that those things are unbelievably strong and I know I could take out,<br>
			multiple zombies with it. My second step after getting weapons is to find a hiding<br>
			place (anywhere above ground because I’d like to believe zombies can’t climb stairs)<br>
			because there's no way I'm just going to just kill zombies since that would be boring.<br>
			Lastly, after I’d set up camp I’d go find food and water (bringing my portable pressure<br>
			washer with me still of course).
